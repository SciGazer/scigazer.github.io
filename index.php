          <p>Hi! my name is Princess. I am a BS Computer Engineering graduate at Cavite State University. I have a passion for software programming, web development and designing, which I honed through number of creative projects and activities on the courses I took at CvSU.</p>

          <p>I was also able to practice project management and other IT works on my internship at Philippine Batteries Inc (PBI). While studying on my last year in college, I also worked as a part time Engineering and Control staff (as trainee) at Shoshiba Filipina Inc (SFInc) where I experience data recording, inventory system management and working with different teams to provide quality products.</p>

          <p>70% Introvert, 30% Extrovert.<br>Analytical, kinesthetic learner.<br>The spotlight is not my friend.<br>Planner, yet pro spontaneity.<br>Dorky and passionate...<br>thatâ€™s approximately me.</p>
